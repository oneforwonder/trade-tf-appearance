trade-tf-appearance
===================

Removes the slate color scheme and makes other small changes to the layout/appearance of trade.tf

Usage
-----

You must have a browser add-on (such as Greasemonkey for Firefox) that allows you to run userscripts.
Add this script, reload trade.tf, and the appearance should change.

Caution
-------

The approach used by this script is brittle and could break with future trade.tf versions.
If things look horribly wrong, uninstall the script.

License
-------

This code can be used for any purpose, commercial or otherwise, with no requirement that the author
be credited. If you would like to credit me, however, that'd be just fine with me :)
